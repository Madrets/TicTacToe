# TicTacToe

This is a desktop program that simulates the popular paper game called "Tic Tac Toe" (also known as "Noughts and Crosses" or "Xs and Os"). Only offline multiplayer is supported at the moment.

## Gameplay Screenshots
During gameplay, clicked buttons become disabled. Squares that have not been clicked display the icon of the current player when the mouse hovers over them.

The menu bar provides the following shortcuts: 
* **New**: Start a new game. Can be done at any point.
* **Quit**: Closes the program.
* **Change Starting Player**: Change the starting player. Player X starts the first game by default. This menu option allows the starting player to be changed at the beginning of a round. This button will not work while a game is in progress.

When there is a winner, all buttons on the board become disabled. The stats section indicates the winner, and the stats are updated when a new game starts. A new game can be started from the menu bar.
